# odin-recipes

Started working on this project just now from the beginning, while walking through the very first steps!

* Created this repository
* Created a Readme file inside the repository
* Copied the SSH link copied this repository inside the repos folder
* Accessed the readme file through the bash terminal to write down this process and keep writing my progress on the project itself.
* Proceeded with further setting Git and commitment settings
